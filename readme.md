first thing i did is, installing nextjs framework to handle the routing, by 

npm install nextjs@latest


The advantage using nextjs is  folder base route, which is reducing my time rather than linking file per file.

because my website is static file based, im using markdown react which is mdx. How it works is simply rendering the mdx file to html by 

npm install mdx...
